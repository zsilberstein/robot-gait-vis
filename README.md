# Robot-Gait-Vis

Robot-Gait-Vis is a python project to simulate and visualize different walking robot configurations and gaits.

## About
This project was designed to help rapidly visualize the performance of different 
gaits and trajectories for various walking robots. The project assumes no slip while walking.

## Installation


## Example Usage
The example.py file illustrates example usage of the package. The example file generates walking motion 
for a simple biped robot and outputs the GIF shown below.
